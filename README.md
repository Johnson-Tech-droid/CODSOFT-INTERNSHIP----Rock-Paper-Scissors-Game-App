### Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
During the CODSOFT Internship, I was tasked with creating a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game, a project designed to enhance my Python programming and GUI development skills. This interactive game simulates the classic hand game, allowing players to compete against the computer. The project emphasized designing user-friendly interfaces and integrating randomness for an engaging and fair gameplay experience.

### Key Features of the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
User-Friendly Interface:
A sleek, interactive GUI built using Python's Tkinter module.
Buttons for player choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors) and a dynamic display of game results.
Real-Time Feedback:
Immediate feedback on the result (Win, Lose, or Draw) after each round.
A live scoreboard that tracks the player's and computer's performance.
Randomized Gameplay:
Utilizes Python's random module to generate unpredictable moves for the computer.
Ensures fairness and excitement in every round.
Error Handling and Validation:
Robust handling of edge cases to maintain a smooth user experience.
Validates the player’s inputs and gracefully manages unexpected errors.
Skills Developed
Randomization and Decision Logic:
Mastery in using Python’s random module to ensure randomness in gameplay.
